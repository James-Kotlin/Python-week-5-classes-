Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class!
# Base class representing a generic character
class Character:

        self.age = age

        return f"I am {self.name}, aged {self.age}. My main power is {self.power}!"

    def use_power(self):
        return f"{self.name} is using their power: {self.power}!"

# Derived class representing a Superhero

# Derived class representing a Villain
class Villain(Character):

# Example objects
superhero = Superhero("Clark Kent", 30, "Super Strength", "Superman", "Justice League")
villain = Villain("Lex Luthor", 45, "Genius Intellect", "Superman")

# Example outputs
print(superhero.introduce())
print(superhero.use_power())
print(villain.introduce())
print(villain.use_power())

Assignment two::
# Base class
class Vehicle:
    def move(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("This method should be overridden by subclasses")

# Derived class representing a Car
class Car(Vehicle):
    def move(self):

# Derived class representing a Plane
class Plane(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        return "Flying ‚úàÔ∏è"

# Derived class representing a Boat
class Boat(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        return "Sailing üö§"
# Derived class representing a Bicycle 
class Bicycle (Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        return "Cycling"

# Example objects

# Iterate through each vehicle and call their move() method
for vehicle in vehicles:
    print(vehicle.move())
